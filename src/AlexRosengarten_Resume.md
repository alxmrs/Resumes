WORK EXPERIENCE
===============

**Software Engineer in Machine Learning** /11 \| Present\
Aira Tech Cop -- La Jolla & San Jose, CA\
*Aira helps blind and low-vision users access visual information via
remote assistance with smart glasses.*

-   Built **core dialog engine (Chloe)** on Android. Integrated STT/TTS
    system and conversation state management. Built features such as
    bluetooth pairing, calling an agent, and call rating purely through
    a voice interface (Java 8).

-   Developed cloud-based, [**real-time object
    detector**](https://github.com/aira/object_detector). AI agent used
    NLP, computer vision, and deep learning for NSF grant, designed to
    assist blind & low-vision users (Tensorflow, OpenCV, MQTT).

-   Technical lead for prototype of **indoor navigation system**
    (OpenSfM, PCL, Python, Android, ArchGIS).

-   Project lead for **Horus**, a batch ETL & analytics tool for video
    streams (Python, Docker, AWS).

-   Creating **image tagging game** to generate dataset integral to
    company IP (Spring Boot, Vue.js, Typescript).

-   Created **currency classifier**. Built CNN model. Deployed on
    Android with Firebase (Tensorflow, Android).

-   Built **telemetry system**, captures user & Chloe utterances. Speech
    simulation key to test automation (AWS IoT).

-   Making important design & architecture decisions on AI products,
    e.g. inter-day call forcasting, OCR reading.

-   Leading agile rituals such as daily standups, sprint plannings and
    retrospectives.

-   Founded weekly lecture series to teach engineers machine learning.

**Software Engineer** /08 \| 2017/11\
Intuit -- San Diego, CA

-   Developed features for **ProSeries**, Windows professional tax
    software (C\#, C++).

-   **Won business unit hackathon** with novel idea for a telemetry
    system, presented to senior leadership.

-   **Led telemetry project**. Took initiative to modernize legacy
    application with data.

-   Implemented [**application crash analysis
    tool**](https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/CrashAnalysisTool), produced
    more accurate reports in half the time (Python).

-   Ideas I designed and executed led to a 50% reduction in application
    crashes from prior year.

**Research Assistant** /06 \| 2015/09\
Natural Computation Laboratory (de Sa Lab), UCSD Cognitive Science
Department -- La Jolla, CA

-   Created [**in-ear EEG**](https://youtu.be/UMACp0fc9TA) device to
    detect seizures for people with epilepsy (SVMs, OpenBCI).

-   Built custom neural network layer for [**learned-norm
    pooling**](https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/LearnedNormPooling) in EEG
    research application (Theano).

-   Created hands-on workshops to **teach brain computer interface
    technology** (OpenBCI, Python).

-   Developed [**BrainTag**](https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/BrainTag), a
    lasertag-based neurofeedback game for children with Autism (Arduino,
    C).

-   Presented research at UCSD Undergraduate Research Conference 2015.

PROJECTS
========

**Research Assistant** /01 \| Present\
Vecchio Group, UCSD Nanoengineering Department -- La Jolla, CA

-   Published [**"Paradigm Shift in Electron-Based Crystallography via
    Machine
    Learning"**](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1902/1902.03682.pdf)
    (Tensorflow).

-   Used OOP design principles for framework to track hyperparameters,
    ML pipelines in version control (Python).

-   **Teaching graduate students** programming best-practices and
    machine learning concepts.

**Co-Creator of Computer Music Library** /10 \| Present\
Huh, Computer Music (HCM) -- San Diego, CA

-   Developing
    [**open-source**](https://github.com/alxrsngrtn/huh-computer-music)
    Python 3 library for real-time **music generation**.

-   Presented **["Music from Chaos: Audiofying the Lorenz
    Attractor"](https://youtu.be/bTAFl8P2DkE?t=28m47s)** at PyCon, 2018.

-   Library utilizes functional reactive programming for live streaming
    (RxPy).

-   Tool aims to mimic an analog synthesizer through functional
    composition (Numpy, Scipy).
