\section{WORK EXPERIENCE} 
{\bf Machine Learning/Software Engineer } \hfill Nov 2017 - Present \\
  Aira -- La Jolla, CA
  \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
    \item Developing {\bf Chloe}, a mobile-AI for new product line (Android, RxJava). 
    \item Building {\bf core dialog engine}. Includes a STT/TTS system and conversation state management. Built features such as bluetooth pairing, calling an agent, and call rating purely throuch a voice interface. 
    \item Built cloud-based, \href{https://github.com/aira/object_detector}{{\bf real-time object detector}}.  AI agent used NLP, computer vision, and deep learning for NSF grant, designed to assist blind/low-vision users. (Tensorflow, OpenCV, MQTT).
    \item AI agent can describe the color, amount, and type of 100 classes of objects in milliseconds.
    \item Created {\bf wake word detector}. Built a CNN model and audio processing pipeline (Tensorflow).
    \item Built a {\bf telemetry system} that captures speech utterances from users and the device. Speech simulation added for automated testing (AWS IoT, MQTT, DynamoDB).
    \item Added {\bf fisheye correction} in glasses camera driver (OpenCV, Android Native).
    \item Started a weekly lecture series to teach engineers machine learning. 
  \end{itemize} 


{\bf Software Engineer} \hfill Aug 2016 - Nov 2017 \\
  Intuit -- San Diego, CA
  \begin{itemize}  \itemsep -2pt %reduce space between items
